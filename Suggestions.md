## Suggestions for the package
- [ ] Support of map variation, maybe dark/light map version
- [ ] Have more default layout for the popup component, right now it is very plain, maybe add a dark version as well
- [ ] To add on previous point, maybe have a theme option for users to select different style for the map and other components (popup window, controllers)
- [ ] Potential legend component
- [ ] Time ticker component to handle temporal dataset

## Suggestions for the document
- [ ] The code snippet in the front page of the documentation doesn't seem to work directly, the github repo has the correct one
- [ ] It will be nice to have more code examples we can directly copy from, or more tutorials
- [ ] Need search function in the document for easier navigation
- [ ] Maybe list some features/advantages to distinguish this open source project from other web mapping project
- [ ] On this page: https://ol-kit.com/tutorial-Getting%20Started.html, the link for `how that works` is invalid
- [ ] On this page: https://ol-kit.com/gl, `connectToMap` section has some format issue
